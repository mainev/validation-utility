# validation-utility

ValidationUtility is a .NET library designed to validate and transform data easily. It offers validation in  multiple data formats, including numbers, dates, and custom regex patterns. The library supports configurable options such as rejecting invalid data, truncating values, and applying default values when necessary. It also accommodates various data formatting requirements, such as handling separators, enforcing maximum lengths, and supporting cultural settings. This library is designed to be used for data preprocessing tasks, such as importing data from a file to a database.![image](https://github.com/mainev/validation-utility/assets/11971741/7c74d6b2-2592-4159-8c24-2698e7fa03a0)
